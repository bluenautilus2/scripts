First, make sure you can login to their stackoverflow site, you may have to create a new account.
https://stackoverflow.web.fedex.com/

Then, create a "service account" for your app:
https://stackoverflow.web.fedex.com/questions/458/how-do-i-create-a-service-account-for-jenkins-to-deploy-to-pcf

when you create that request it's REALLY important to chose "corp.ds.fedex.com" as the Service Acct Domain. Also make sure to name the Service Account name with FXS_app1234567 as the format.  See below

Requester Name: Elizabeth Stevens (3756070) 
Requester Dept: Retail Experience Solutions 
Requester E-mail: elizabethstevens.osv@fedex.com

Request Type: Create domain service account 

Service Acct Domain: Corp.ds.fedex.com 
Service Acct Name: FXS_app3535135 
Service Acct Password: SMrGBy8La2bzuZuHGGHJaqIEv

THEN: once that is created they will email you a password. Wait 24 hours for the entry to actually get into LDAP.  Keep that password. Then after 24 hours submit the second ticket. Here are instructions: https://gitlab.prod.fedex.com/APP6143/reference-pipeline/wikis/PCF-Deploy

those instructions are mostly correct, a person will reply to the ticket asking you for the password. Mine forced me to install Skype for Business and send her the password that way, but later I found out she would accept an email also.
