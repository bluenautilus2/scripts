mvn liquibase:rollback -Dliquibase.rollbackCount=1

IMPORTANT: if you have a series of changes and some of them can't be rolled back, and no
rollback has been provided, liquibase will happily stop the rollback and not execute anything
earlier than the "show-stopping" change. and give a positive status.

---------------------
1 - when a script fails, does it go on to the next in the list?
2 - when a script fails, and the changeset is run again, does it attempt it a second time with no updates?
3 - when a script runs correctly, and the changeset is updated, does it attempt it a second time?
4 - when a script fails, and the database itself is changed, does that affect liquibase's behavior?
5 - when a script fails and stops, and doesn't run any more scripts, what happens the second time the set is run?
*6 - if someone puts in a changeSet into a section that was already run succesfully, what does liquibase do?
6 - how are rollbacks targeted and run?

7 - what happens when a rollback fails?
8 - when a rollback fails, are subsequent scripts run?

answers:
1a - If there are any format issues in a changeSet, and the beans for liquibase can't be created, NO changesets are run. So if a teammate checks one in that's wrong, no one can run any changesets until it's fixed, not even the ones before the one with the formatting issue
1b - If a script fails, that script is not entered into the databasechangelog table at all. (not even with an error).
Any scripts after it are not executed. Scripts before it are, though.
2 - yes  
3 - No, and in fact liquibase detects the change and comes to a complete stop because it changed, and nothing else is attempted.
4 - No, because there's no record of the script failing the first time
5 - Fails again
6 - 

If you turn on the rollbacks for the DSL, are they generated and put somewhere?
