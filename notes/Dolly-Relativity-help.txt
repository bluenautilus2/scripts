Dolly's help with PC and Relativity

-----------
Devbrains-11 is where the automated tests run every night, and they create
datasets and training sessions you can look at. Code is from the latest 6.3
I have a login called "beth@brainspace.com" with password Discovery1!  to log in 
and look at it.

If I need to login and use Relativity, I can log into:

https://devrel10-01.corp.brainspace.com/Relativity/External.aspx?AppID=-1&ArtifactID=62&ArtifactTypeID=8&navigateListPage=True&DirectTo=%25applicationpath%25%2FCustomPages%2F2ff16b11-a4ca-4f02-8bbb-1f07f23fe713%2Findex.html%3F%25appid%25%26%25artifacttypeid%25%26%25systemid%25&SelectedTab=1015520#/ViewId=112

there is a "workspace" in there called "smoke test" that's the one to use.

This instance of Relativity has a login of "support@brainspace.com" and password "Discovery1!"

You can log into any brainspace test setup, and create a new dataset, using this 
Relativity instance. You set it as a "replplus" connector
