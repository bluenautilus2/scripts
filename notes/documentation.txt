Documentation Meeting
------------
Our pain points and/or issues

- Need a list of viewer tools to view complex file types, esp. architecture diagrams like omnigrapple. 
  - follow up question: should we try to standardize on any specific diagramming tools?
- Customer requests and issues lose details along the way;  QA often doesn't know if the implemented solution is what was asked for
- Sales has good documentation/presentation for customer flows and use cases that we can't get to
- Documentation is out of sync with our software versions
- Portability - some content is not shared with team
- Some docs have no place to go - Ex: meeting minutes
- Desire for docs to live closer to the code, apart from ongoing issues documented in Jira
- Jira is missing important conversations about what was decided
- Slack channels are helpful in the short term but proliferate over time
- Updating the docs in Github is painful because they are tied to features

Solutions Mentioned

- Evernote
- Confluence/Wiki
- Madcap Flare
- Adobe Framemaker
- XMetal

Two paths forward:

- Our workflow: how/when we stop to write down what we're working on and guidelines for it
- Getting to our content: finding the things we need across the different tools
